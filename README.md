> A simple RPG game built with Phaser 3.

![screenshot](Screenshot.png)


## Game instructions

- Players must try to collect the stars as fast as they can.
- To collect a star, simply walk through it.
- Players must find the Secret start before time runs out.
- The time acts as the score.
- The goal is to find the secret star in the least amount of time.
- The secret star might be trapped inside of an obstacle such as a tree or unfinished building. If the secret star is one of those trapped stars, then the player will not get the highest score. One must be fast and lucky to get the highest score.
- After a game has finished, the leaderboard will pop-up to show the player where he stands among the best Secret Ninja Star players.
